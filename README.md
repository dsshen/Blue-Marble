# Blue Marble

This repository contains the dev source code for Blue Marble, a React web app that uses NASA's [EPIC API](https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api) and LocationIQ's [Geocoding API](https://locationiq.com/geocoding) to display natural color images of Earth from NASA's DSCOVR satellite, centered (if possible) on a location you have specified. The live site can be viewed [here](https://dsshen.github.io/blue-marble/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Its live production build was deployed using [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages).
